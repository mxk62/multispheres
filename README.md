Rudimentary implementation of Stokesian Dynamics for spheres in a channel


## Description

Program calculates trajectories of *N* identical, conductive spheres suspended
in a viscous fluid at low Reynolds number (i.e. when all inertial effects are
negligible) using Stokesian Dynamics approaching.

The suspension is between two oppositely charged, flat electrodes (slab
geometry).

Both hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions between spheres and the walls
are *not* implemented yet.
